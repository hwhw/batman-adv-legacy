Description:
                The /sys/class/net/<iface>/batman-adv14/mesh_iface file
                displays the batman mesh interface this <iface>
                currently is associated with.

Description:
                With this option set incoming multicast payload frames on
                <iface> are not being rebroadcasted on <iface> again. This
                option should be set on links which are known to be transitive
                and symmetric only, for instance point-to-point wifi longshots
                or wired links. Using this option wrongly is going to
                break your mesh network, use at your own risk!
